# App Icons

To make the PWA installable on mobile devices, you need to add icon files here.

## Required Icons

Create PNG icons with these sizes:
- 72x72
- 96x96
- 128x128
- 144x144
- 152x152
- 192x192
- 384x384
- 512x512

## Quick Solution

You can use an online tool like:

Or create a simple icon with a purple background and a checkmark/calendar emoji.

For now, the app will work without icons, but users won't be able to install it as a PWA.
